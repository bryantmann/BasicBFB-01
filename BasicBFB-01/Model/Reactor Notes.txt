Reactor Class Plan

Properties
- Pyrolysis pyro
- List<double> z
- List<double[]> mDot
- double mChar
- GasifierParams param 
- Stream pyrolysisGas
- double Lbed

- Components in Mdot elements are ordered same as Stream class
	- (i = CO, CO2, CH4, H2, H2O, N2, O2, S, Tar)
- Char content quantified by mass holdup in bed (a single number) = mChar
- z spacing is unknown since ode45 has variable step sizes.  
  Substitute zIndex for z

- Setup
	- Do pyrolysis
	- Mix badGasOut and dryGasOut streams to get pyrolysisGas
	- Add z = 0, and add array with initial conditions to mDot
	- Initialize mChar with user-provided guess                                    

- Helper functions:
	- double[] y(zIndex): Mole fractions in gas phase (incl. tar)
	- double partialP(Component cmp, int zIndex)
	- double conc(Component cmp, int zIndex)
	- double U(int zIndex)
	- double dBubble(z)
	- double eps(z)
	- double Lbed
	- mDot(N2, O2, H2S) - From badGasOut
	- double avgEps (avg bed voidage)
	- double tauP = (1-epsBar)*Lbed / U

- Gasification reaction rate vs. position
	- rxn_i(z): 5 functions

Equations for Model:
	. dm(CO)/dz
	. dm(CO2)/dz
	. dm(CH4)/dz
	. dm(H2)/dz
	. dm(H2O)/dz
	. dm(N2)/dz = dm(O2)/dz = dm(H2S)/dz = 0.0
	. dm(Tar)/dz

	. Mchar - an integral equation (need an integration algorithm in Solver)

Algorithm:
. Overall goal is for mDot(char) = 0 at freeboard section effluent
. Guess alpha = 0.9 (char conversion)
. From alpha, calculate avg solids restime tauP using td and te
	. Start with a guess for MChar (user input), at current fixed tauP(alpha)
	. Set local mCharOld = mChar
	. Solve system of ODEs -> populates z and mDot lists
	. Calculate mChar using mDot values
	. Compare mCharErr = abs(mChar - mCharOld) / mChar
	. Repeat until mCharErr <= charTol (start with modest 1e-3)
	. Next calculate new Lbed value
	. Repeat char and Lbed loops until both mChar and Lbed converge
. Assuming char fines travel with gas in freeboard, calculate char conversion
  in freeboard section to obtain mCharOut at z = Ltot
. Using zRiddr root finding algorithm, optimize alpha/tauP so that mCharOut = 0

Results
	. Clean dry gas mole fractions in effluent
	. Yield (kg/kg biomass) of Gas, Tar and Char in effluent


Note: eps_mf = 0.41408 for spherical particles
