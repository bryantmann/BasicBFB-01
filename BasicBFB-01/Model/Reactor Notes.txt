Reactor Class Plan

Properties
- Pyrolysis pyro
- List<double> z
- List<double[]> mDot
- double mChar, initialized with a guess passed to constructor as argument
- Include GasifierParams param 

- Components in Mdot elements are ordered same as Stream class
	- (i = CO, CO2, CH4, H2, H2O, N2, O2, S, Tar)
- Char content quantified by mass holdup in bed (a single number) = mChar
- z spacing is unknown since ode45 has variable step sizes.  
  Substitute zIndex for z

- Helper functions:
	- double[] y(zIndex): Mole fractions in gas phase (incl. tar)
	- double partialP(Component cmp, int zIndex)
	- double conc(Component cmp, int zIndex)
	- double U(int zIndex)
	- double dBubble(z)
	- double eps(z)
	- double Lbed
	- mDot(N2, O2, H2S) - From badGasOut
	- double avgEps (avg bed voidage)

- Gasification reaction rate vs. position
	- rxn_i(z): 5 functions

Equations for Model:
	. dm(CO)/dz
	. dm(CO2)/dz
	. dm(CH4)/dz
	. dm(H2)/dz
	. dm(H2O)/dz
	. dm(N2)/dz = dm(O2)/dz = dm(H2S)/dz = 0.0
	. dm(Tar)/dz

	. Mchar - an integral equation (need an integration algorithm in Solver)

Algorithm:
	. Start with a guess for mChar (user input)
	. Set local mCharOld = mChar
	. Solve system of ODEs -> populates z and mDot lists
	. Calculate mChar using mDot values
	. Compare mCharErr = abs(mChar - mCharOld) / mChar
	. Repeat until mCharErr <= charTol (start with modest 1e-3)

Results
	. Clean dry gas mole fractions in effluent
	. Yield (kg/kg biomass) of Gas, Tar and Char in effluent
	.
